ClojureCLR

This project is a native implementation of Clojure on the Common Language Runtime (CLR),
the execution engine of Microsoft's .Net Framework.

ClojureCLR is programmed in C# (and Clojure itself) and makes use of Microsoft's
Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR).


Goals:

 -- Implement a feature-complete Clojure on top of CLR/DLR.
 -- Stay as close as possible to the JVM implementation.
 -- Have some fun.
